landing site https://pucsdalums.github.io/public

#### Instructions to modify the site
We created initial index.html from github pages stylesheets. But this is very limiting, since we will required several pages and links both internal and external.

In order to use minimal setup environment and quick updates, we chose to use markdown. 
Git can auto convert md to html but we needed a nicer and easy to read format, i.e. stylesheets.
 Therefore, a step to convert markdown to html on local PC/Mac is necessary

It uses local parser called generate-md (installed via markdown-styles). 

  
1. Local installation
	- Install WSL on windows to use Ubuntu - to get linux environment.
	- Install git - 'sudo apt install git'
	- install npm - 'sudo apt install npm'
	- sudo npm install -g markdown-styles
2. Main landing page is through index.html. This file should be modified directly. 
		- Recommended editors - vi, sublimeText. I messed up a bit when I tried online html editor.
3. Rest of the sub-modules are through markdown files in 'pages/' directory 
	- This  requires a few steps (for now)  _TODO_ automate.
		1. git clone  https://github.com/pucsdalums/public.git
        2. Modify .md file you are interested in
	    3. run command "rm -fr html; generate-md --input . --layout mixu-bootstrap-2col  --output ./html"
	- generated html is in pages/html directory. Load it using browser to see you are satisfied with the changes.
	- git push your changes.
4. Other tools
	- Online html  editor : https://html-online.com/editor/
	- Online md to html editor: https://markdowntohtml.com/
	- install text editor Sublime text
	- https://github.com/mixu/markdown-styles

5. File structure
	public/index.html
		  | styles
		  | pages       --> location for all markdown files.
		  | pages/html   --> auto generated by generate.md. 

6. If you are struggling with local setup - just push your .md file and I will generate html for you.
